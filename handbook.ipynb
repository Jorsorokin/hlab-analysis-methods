    "If you are new to Julia, fear not, it is quite similar to MATLAB. There are, however a few peculiarities to take care of. First, in Julia we need to *import* packages to use certain functions. For instance, there are no built-in plotting functions, but there is a handy _Plots_ package that we can install and use. In general, to increase the flexibility of Julia we first need to (a) install desired packages, and (b) import them when we wish to use them. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the most part, Julia code will look very familiar if you have learned Python and/or MATLAB (it uses the best of both worlds: MATLAB's intuitive linear algebra framework with Python's general-purposeness & modularity). Plotting is a bit different, as are some of the data structures (for instance, a row-vector does not behave the same as a column-vector, but we'll get into that next)\n",

    "For now, we will need to install at least a few additional packages to get up to speed.
