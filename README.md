# hlab-analysis-methods
Code, slides, and figs on various analysis techniques

This repository contains a variety of instructional code and slides for Hlab analysis mini-lectures. The purpose is to provide examples of applied mathematical analyses to typical neural data recorded in the Hlab. 

## Structure
Each week we will discuss a specific topic and dive into real data. The repository will continuously grow with new folders added for each topic. Expected topics to be covered are:

1. Linear algebra & matrix/vector data representations
    * inner / outer products
    * matrices as affine functions
    * geometrical perspective
2. Statistical signal/image processing
    * filtering & fourier analysis
    * convolution 
    * auto-correlations and auto-regression
    * event detection / shift detection
    * time-series decomposition
    * object identification / edge & ridge detection
3. Matrix/tensor factorization
    * general framework of matrix factorization
    * eigenvectors/eigenvalues & PCA
    * NMF, sparse PCA, ICA
    * CANDECOMP/PARAFAC
    * smoothing/denoising & dimensionality reduction
4. Unsupervised clustering
    * k-means, k-medians
    * mixture models, EM 
    * density-based clustering
5. Graph Theory
    * representation & construction
    * decomposition (laplacian eigmaps, spectral clustering)
    * inference & applications to time series data
6. Supervised learning (regression, classification)
    * linear, multiple regression
    * logistic regression
    * regularization
7. Parametric and non-parametric statistics
    * bootstrapping / sampling

    * quantitative comparisons of distributions
    * self-created statistical tests
8. Probability theory & bayesian analysis
    * stochastic vs. deterministic signals
    * bayes rule & chain rule
    * conditional probability and expectation/conditional expectation
    * graphical models & inference
9. Data visualization
    * dimensionality reduction and visualization
    * multi-variate distributions
    * time-series & movies
10. Deep learning
    * single-layer MLPs <--> logistic regression
    * Naive Bayes 
    * multi-layer MLPs and non-linear activations
