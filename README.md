# hlab-analysis-methods
Code, slides, and figs on various analysis techniques

This repository contains a variety of instructional code and slides for Hlab analysis mini-lectures. The purpose is to provide examples of applied mathematical analyses to typical neural data recorded in the Hlab. 

## Structure
Each week we will discuss a specific topic and dive into real data. The repository will continuously grow with new folders added for each topic. Expected topics to be covered are:

Linear algebra & matrix/vector data representations

Statistical signal processing

Statistical image processing

Matrix/tensor factorization for smoothing & dimensionality reduction

Unsupervised clustering

Supervised learning (regression, classification)

Parametric and non-parametric statistics

Probability theory/distribution estimation

Data visualization

Deep learning (MLPs, Naive Bayes)
